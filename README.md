# Book-rating-classification

This project successfully tackled the "Goodreads Books Reviews" Kaggle Competition. The goal of the competition was to predict review ratings ranging from 0 to 5, using a dataset of reviews from the Goodreads book review website and various item attributes. To achieve this, I implemented a variety of custom deep neural network models that leveraged a combination of recurrent layers, such as LSTM's, and feature extracting layers, including Convolutional and Temporal Convolutional Layers.
